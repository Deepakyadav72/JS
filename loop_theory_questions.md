# Loop Questions: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced

---

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Level (Fundamentals of Loops)

1. What is a loop and why do we use it in programming?
2. Explain the difference between `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
3. What happens if the loop condition is always `true`?
4. How do you exit a loop before it finishes all iterations?
5. What is the role of the loop counter in a `for` loop?
6. When would you prefer a `while` loop over a `for` loop?
7. Explain the difference between `break` and `continue` in loops.
8. Can you run a loop without a body? If yes, how?
9. What is an infinite loop? Give an example scenario.
10. How do nested loops work?

## ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level (Problem Solving with Loops)

1. How would you print all even numbers between 1 and 100 using a loop?
2. Explain how to calculate the sum of digits of a number using loops.
3. How can you reverse a string using a loop?
4. How would you find the factorial of a number using a loop?
5. Write the logic to check whether a number is prime using loops.
6. How can you use loops to generate a multiplication table?
7. Explain how to use nested loops to print a triangle/star pattern.
8. How can loops be used to search for an element in an array?
9. Describe a way to find the largest and smallest number in an array using loops.
10. How can you count the frequency of characters in a string using loops?

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Level (Logic & Optimization with Loops)

1. How would you optimize a loop that processes a very large dataset?
2. Can you write a loop without using a condition (infinite but controlled externally)?
3. Explain how to break out of nested loops efficiently.
4. How can you detect if a loop will run infinitely just by looking at the logic?
5. What is the time complexity of nested loops and how does it affect performance?
6. How can you use loops to implement sorting algorithms (like bubble sort, selection sort)?
7. Explain how loops are used in matrix multiplication.
8. How would you simulate recursion using loops?
9. How can you optimize a nested loop using a single loop with mathematical formulas?
10. What are some real-world scenarios where replacing recursion with loops is beneficial?
