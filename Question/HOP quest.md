3.  How is a higher-order function different from a normal function?\
4.  Can a higher-order function return another function? Explain.\
5.  Why are higher-order functions important in functional programming?

## Intermediate Level

6.  Explain how `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are examples of
    higher-order functions.\
7.  How would you use a higher-order function to transform an array of
    numbers?\
